# HW-Web

The work involved creating a webpage for the weather data which was analyzed previously. 
Used Web tools like Bootstrap and also used Javascript.
Styling the pages with CSS was time consuming.
I had some challenges displaying the table in the correct format.
Overall, it was a good homework to learn HTML.
